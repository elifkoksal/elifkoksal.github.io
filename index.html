                <p> My research activities are in the field of computational Neuroscience with the aim of deciphering the computational underpinnings

                    My scientific expertise is multiple timescale systems, synchronization, neural models, and neurophysiology, 
                    with a focus on complex neuronal dynamics from microscopic to macroscopic levels.

                            <li><p> <b>Decoding cognitive impairments in patients with epilepsy</b></p>
                          <p>Epilepsy is a multi-causal neurological disorder affecting about 65 million of the population worldwide. 
                          Epilepsy is known for its clinical manifestations (seizures) and subclinical manifestations (interictal epileptic discharges - IEDs -). 
                          Although subclinical, IEDs perturb neuroplasticity processes by altering or inhibiting the physiological activity of cortical networks. 
                          IEDs have long-term adverse effects on developing brain circuits and can cause long-term cognitive deficits in patients that negatively 
                          impact their lives as much as seizures do. I am interested in how IEDs perturb the brain dynamics and what are the links between the 
                          electrophysiological properties of IEDs and cognitive deficits in patients with epilepsy. I tackle these questions from two perspectives:</p>
                         <ol> 
                         <li> <p>mathematical modeling: neural activity in the brain operates across multiple scales, encompassing both spatial (inter- and intra-areal) and temporal 
                         (slow and fast) dynamics. I develop multiscale <em>in silico</em> models to decipher the neural circuitry that mediates healthy and pathological neural 
                         activity. These models function as a multiscale system, involving fast and slow circuits, with rigorous mathematical tools applied to understand the 
                         interactions between these timescales. </p></li> 
                          
                        <li> <p>electrophysiology: one of the most recurrent questions in epilepsy neuro-pediatric clinics is whether IEDs, 
                            which are one of the reasons for cognitive impairments in children with epilepsy, should be treated or not. 
                        <b>ECOFEC</b> (Evolution of cognitive functions under epileptic activity in children) project combines signal processing and 
                        clinical data to track the biomarkers that can guide clinical practice. 
                        ECOFEC is in collaboration with Manon Boyer and Isabelle Merlet (LTSI, Inserm, Rennes), and Sylvie Napuri, Anna Michel and Constantin Gomes (Neuropediatry Department, CHU-Sud, Rennes). 
                        It is financed by the <a href ="https://www.incr.fr/">INCR</a> (Institut des Neurosciences Cliniques de Rennes, 2024-2025).</p></li>

                    <li><p><b>Associative memory from multiple timescale point of view</b></p>
                        <p>The processing of sequences of items in memory is a fundamental issue for the brain to generate sequences of stimuli necessary for goal-directed behavior, 
                            language processing, musical performance, thinking and decision making and more generally prediction. Those processes rely on priming mechanisms in which 
                            a triggering stimulus (e.g. a prime word) activates items in memory corresponding to stimuli not actually presented (e.g. target words). 
                            A given triggering stimulus can generate two types of sequences: on the one hand, the systematic activation of the same sequence is required to repeat 
                            reliable behaviors; on the other hand, the generation of variable sequences is necessary for the creation of new behaviors. 
                            Hence the brain has to face two opposite constraints of generating repetitive sequences or of generating new sequences. 
                            Can a neural network with a fixed synaptic matrix switch behavior between reproducing a sequence and produce new sequences? 
                            What are the neuronal mechanisms sufficient for such switch in the type of sequence generated? 
                            How does a neural network react to changing enviroment and adapt itself dynamically?
                            We are studying these questions in a minimal and mathematically tractable model with 
                        Pascal Chossat (MathNeuro Team, INRIA-UNS-CNRS, Nice), Frédéric Lavigne (BCL, Université Côte d'Azur, Nice) and Arnaud Rey (Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive, CNRS, Marseille).
